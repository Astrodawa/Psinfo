# Psinfo
Psinfo is a Volatility plugin which collects the process related information from the VAD (Virtual Address Descriptor) and PEB (Process Enivornment Block) and displays the collected information and suspicious memory regions for all the processes running on the system. This plugin should allow a security analyst to get the process related information and spot any process anamoly without having to run multiple plugins.
